# Learning Objectives

In this module, you will learn methods and tools for energy data analysis. Principles and procedures for the design of an electrical energy storage system form a central thematic focus.

The methods covered include:

- descriptive data analysis

- exploratory data analysis

- inferential data analysis

- complementary use of indicator-based and visualization-based methods

The tools presented include:

- visualization of a sorted load-duration curve

- calculation of residual load and remaining load

- limit-current analysis

- sizing of an electrical storage system considering efficiency and curtailment of generation peaks, calculation of the realized number of cycles, annual profiles, and the potential along the expansion pathway of renewable energies

Keywords: comparative analysis of electricity market data, data visualization, storage system design
